# Hypnotic

## Description
This is a hypnotic WebGL demo, with portals, icospheres and blinking circles.
All of these stuff use beats detection (thanks to dancer.js) to make things more immersive, and more hypnotic !

Here is a [live demo](http://jeremy.tuloup.free.fr/demos/hypnotic/index.html) !

Duration (track) : 01:14 

All graphics from scratch, created with Blender and The Gimp.
Music created with LMMS.
